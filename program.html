	<meta property="og:title" content="International Data Science Olympiad"/>
	<meta property="og:description" content="IDSOL is a global ecosystem of contests and events that serves as a platform for students to learn, practice, and expand their knowledge in data science. Its flagship competition — the titular International Data Science Olympiad Finals — invites students from all over the world to submit proposals to solve real-world challenges with data science as presentations and prototypes showcased to judges from academic, industry, and government backgrounds."/>

    <h1>Regional & Local Programs</h1>
    <p>The responsibility of preparing students for the International Data Science Olympiad falls under the organizing committee of the region, territory, or country. While the programs vary in detail, the general preparatory program follows this framework: training, testing, trying, and trial by contest.</p>

      <div id="s1">
        <h1>Training (Education)</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Intensive training: students may join a training program that is endorsed by IDSOL, both teaching the same material, delivered based on the level of the students.</li>
          <li>Extensive coverage: training program covers everything from the fundamental mathematics of data science (probability, statistics, linear algebra) to applications in real-life examples (health and financial applications), and programming modules (Python and Julia).</li>
          <li>Flexible scheduling: program intensity and extensivity can be adjusted accordingly to fit the needs, criteria, and constraints of the students' academic institutions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="s2">
        <h1>Testing (Certification)</h1>
        <p>Students have an option to earn certifications after completing exams to demonstrate mastery over knowledge and skills in data science.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Science Fundamentals, Health Track</li>
          <li>Data Science Fundamentals, Financial Track</li>
          <li>Data Science Programming, Python</li>
          <li>Data Science Programming, Julia</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="s3">
        <h1>Trying (Capstone Project)</h1>
        <p>Students are encouraged to produce a capstone project after acquiring knowledge for designing and building data science applications.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Applying knowledge: students take what they learned from the training to draft a proposal for addressing some real-life challenges with a data science application.</li>
          <li>Mentorship from academic & professionals: students apply to be paired with mentors from academia, industry, and government to provide insights and advice for student projects.</li>
          <li>Prototype or PoC: students may optionally produce a working concept or model implemented with Python or Julia.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="s4">
        <h1>Trial (Competitions)</h1>
        <p>For showcasing and improving capstone projects, a plethora of contests provides precious opportunities to prepare for the International Data Science Olympiad.</p>
        <h3>Hackathons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Intra-school hackathons: a weekend-long contest that puts students within the same school to tackle challenges within a specific theme.</li>
          <li>Inter-school hackathons: a weekend-long contest that puts students within a defined school cluster to tackle challenges within a specific theme.</li>
          <li>District-level hackathons: a weekend-long contest that puts students within schools of one district to tackle challenges within a specific theme.</li>
          <li>Bounty-based hackathons: a weekend-long contest that invites students to tackle challenges defined by an academic, industry, or government entity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Local Data Science Olympiad Finals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Whitepaper Stage (30%): an extensive project proposal with solution design and supporting information; 10-pages limit for main paper, unlimited references and appendices.</li>
          <li>Pitch Presentation Stage (20%): an executive pitch to explain the concept and related information; limit 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Poster & Demo Stage (50%): a standard poster board (36"×48" @300dpi) showcasing the concept and related information, with an optional demo of proof-of-concept or prototype.</li>
          <li>Delegate Selection: local committee may select up to 12 projects to represent their country or territory at the International Competition.</li>
        </ul>
